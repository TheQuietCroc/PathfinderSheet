This is a simpler Pathfinder Character Sheet for roll20

This is not original work.  It is copied heavily from other roll20 character sheets.

Special Thanks go to:
Diana P.
Sam 
All the others on roll20

This code is free for you to use and modify to suit your needs. 

It will NOT be maintained on a regular basis.

It MAY change and this MAY or MAY NOT break your character sheets/game.

Copy it into a custom sheet.

The CSS is a direct copy of Diana P.'s CSS for her D&D 3.5 character sheet.
